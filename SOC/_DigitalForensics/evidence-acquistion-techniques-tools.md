# Evidence Acquisition Techniques & Tools

`Evidence acquisition` is a critical phase in digital forensics, involving the collection of digital artifacts and data from various sources to preserve potential evidence for analysis. This process requires specialized tools and techniques to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and admissibility of the collected evidence. Here's an overview of evidence acquisition techniques commonly used in digital forensics:

- Forensic Imaging
- Extracting Host-based Evidence & Rapid Triage
- Extracting Network Evidence

## Forensic Imaging

Forensic imaging is a fundamental process in digital forensics that involves creating an exact, bit-by-bit copy of digital storage media, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, and memory cards. This process is crucial for preserving the original state of the data, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining the admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings. Forensic imaging plays a critical role in investigations by allowing analysts to examine evidence without altering or compromising the original data.

Below are some forensic imaging tools and solutions:

- [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/digital-forensics-software/ftk-imager): Developed by AccessData (now acquired by Exterro), FTK Imager is one of the most widely used disk imaging tools in the cybersecurity field. It allows us to create perfect copies (or images) of computer disks for analysis, preserving the integrity of the evidence. It also lets us view and analyze the contents of data storage devices without altering the data.
- [AFF4 Imager](https://github.com/Velocidex/c-aff4): A free, open-source tool crafted for creating and duplicating forensic disk images. It's user-friendly and compatible with numerous file systems. A benefit of the AFF4 Imager is its capability to extract files based on their creation time, segment volumes, and reduce the time taken for imaging through compression.
- `DD and DCFLDD`: Both are command-line utilities available on Unix-based systems (including Linux and MacOS). DD is a versatile tool included in most Unix-based systems by default, while DCFLDD is an enhanced version of DD with features specifically useful for forensics, such as hashing.
- `Virtualization Tools`: Given the prevalent use of virtualization in modern systems, incident responders will often need to collect evidence from virtual environments. Depending on the specific virtualization solution, evidence can be gathered by temporarily halting the system and transferring the directory that houses it. Another method is to utilize the snapshot capability present in numerous virtualization software tools.

**Example 2: Mounting a Disk Image with Arsenal Image Mounter**

Let's now see another demonstration of utilizing [Arsenal Image Mounter](https://arsenalrecon.com/downloads) to mount a disk image we have previously created (not the one mentioned above) from a compromised Virtual Machine (VM) running on VMWare. The virtual hard disk of the VM has been stored as `HTBVM01-000003.vmdk`.

After we've installed Arsenal Image Mounter, let's ensure we launch it with `administrative rights`. In the main window of Arsenal Image Mounter, let's click on the `Mount disk image` button. From there, we'll navigate to the location of our `.VMDK` file and select it.

![Arsenal Image Mounter interface showing a mounted VM hard disk with file path and mount points D:, F:, G:.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_mount.png)

Arsenal Image Mounter will then start its analysis of the VMDK file. We'll also have the choice to decide if we want to mount the disk as `read-only` or `read-write`, based on our specific requirements.

_Choosing to mount a disk image as read-only is a foundational step in digital forensics and incident response. This approach is vital for preserving the original state of evidence, ensuring its authenticity and integrity remain intact._

Once mounted, the image will appear as a drive, assigned the letter `D:\`.

## Extracting Host-based Evidence & Rapid Triage

#### Host-based Evidence

Modern operating systems, with Microsoft Windows being a prime example, generate a plethora of evidence artifacts. These can arise from application execution, file modifications, or even the creation of user accounts. Each of these actions leaves behind a trail, providing invaluable insights for incident response analysts.

Evidence on a host system varies in its nature. The term `volatility` refers to the persistence of data on a host system, with volatile data being information that disappears after events such as logoffs or power shutdowns. One crucial type of volatile evidence is the system's active memory. During investigations, especially those concerning malware infections, this live system memory becomes indispensable. Malware often leaves traces within system memory, and losing this evidence can hinder an analyst's investigation. To capture memory, tools like [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager) are commonly employed.

Some other memory acquisition solutions are:

- [WinPmem](https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem): WinPmem has been the default open source memory acquisition driver for windows for a long time. It used to live in the Rekall project, but has recently been separated into its own repository.
- [DumpIt](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows/): A simplistic utility that generates a physical memory dump of Windows and Linux machines. On Windows, it concatenates 32-bit and 64-bit system physical memory into a single output file, making it extremely easy to use.
- [MemDump](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html): MemDump is a free, straightforward command-line utility that enables us to capture the contents of a system's RAM. It’s quite beneficial in forensics investigations or when analyzing a system for malicious activity. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for memory acquisition.
- [Belkasoft RAM Capturer](https://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer): This is another powerful tool we can use for memory acquisition, provided free of charge by Belkasoft. It can capture the RAM of a running Windows computer, even if there's active anti-debugging or anti-dumping protection. This makes it a highly effective tool for extracting as much data as possible during a live forensics investigation.
- [Magnet RAM Capture](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/): Developed by Magnet Forensics, this tool provides a free and simple way to capture the volatile memory of a system.
- [LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME): LiME is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows the acquisition of volatile memory. LiME is unique in that it's designed to be transparent to the target system, evading many common anti-forensic measures.

**Example 1: Acquiring Memory with WinPmem**

Let's now see a demonstration of utilizing `WinPmem` for memory acquisition.

To generate a memory dump, simply execute the command below with Administrator privileges.

        cmd
`C:\Users\X\Downloads> winpmem_mini_x64_rc2.exe memdump.raw`

![Command prompt showing memory dump process with details of memory ranges, buffer size, and acquisition mode.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/image13.png)

---

**Example 2: Acquiring VM Memory**

Here are the steps to acquire memory from a Virtual Machine (VM).

1. Open the running VM's options
2. Suspend the running VM
3. Locate the `.vmem` file inside the VM's directory.

![VMware interface showing steps to suspend a guest: 1. Click 'VM' menu, 2. Select 'Power', 3. Choose 'Suspend Guest'.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/suspend-vm.png)![File explorer showing a folder with virtual machine files, highlighting 'Win7-2515354d.vmem' as a VMEM file.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/suspend-vmem.png)

---

On the other hand, non-volatile data remains on the hard drive, typically persisting through shutdowns. This category includes artifacts such as:

- Registry
- Windows Event Log
- System-related artifacts (e.g., Prefetch, Amcache)
- Application-specific artifacts (e.g., IIS logs, Browser history)

#### Rapid Triage

This approach emphasizes collecting data from potentially compromised systems. The goal is to centralize high-value data, streamlining its indexing and analysis. By centralizing this data, analysts can more effectively deploy tools and techniques, honing in on systems with the most evidentiary value. This targeted approach allows for a deeper dive into digital forensics, offering a clearer picture of the adversary's actions.

One of the best, if not the best, rapid artifact parsing and extraction solutions is [KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor)](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape). Let's see how we can employ `KAPE` to retrieve valuable forensic data from the image we previously mounted with the help of Arsenal Image Mounter (`D:\`).

`KAPE` is a powerful tool in the realm of digital forensics and incident response. Designed to aid forensic experts and investigators, KAPE facilitates the collection and analysis of digital evidence from Windows-based systems. Developed and maintained by `Kroll`, KAPE is celebrated for its comprehensive collection features, adaptability, and intuitive interface. The diagram below illustrates KAPE's operational flow.

![Flowchart showing KAPE process: Source (live system, mounted image, F-Response) to KAPE (target options), Destination (files copied), KAPE (module options), and Module output (programs run).](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape.png)

Image reference: [https://ericzimmerman.github.io/KapeDocs/#!index.md](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/KapeDocs/#!index.md)

KAPE operates based on the principles of `Targets` and `Modules`. These elements guide the tool in processing data and extracting forensic artifacts. When we feed a source to KAPE, it duplicates specific forensic-related files to a designated output directory, all while maintaining the metadata of each file.

![KAPE workflow diagram: Source of data to KAPE for data parsing, processing, and extraction of Windows forensic artifacts, leading to KAPE output.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_working.png)

After downloading, let's unzip the file and launch KAPE. Within the KAPE directory, we'll notice two executable files: `gkape.exe` and `kape.exe`. KAPE provides users with two modes: CLI (`kape.exe`) and GUI (`gkape.exe`).

![File explorer showing KAPE files: 'gkape.exe' for GUI version and 'kape.exe' for CLI version.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_modes.png)

Let's opt for the GUI version to explore the available options more visually.

![gkape interface showing source and destination selection, KAPE target configuration, module options, and execution button.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_window.png)

The crux of the process lies in selecting the appropriate target configurations.

![Table showing KAPE target configuration with 'KapeTriage' selected, described as a compound collection for DFIR investigation.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_target.png)

In KAPE's terminology, `Targets` refer to the specific artifacts we aim to extract from an image or system. These are then duplicated to the output directory.

KAPE's target files have a `.tkape` extension and reside in the `<path to kape>\KAPE\Targets` directory. For instance, the target `RegistryHivesSystem.tkape` in the screenshot below specifies the locations and file masks associated with system-related registry hives. In this target configuration, `RegistryHivesSystem.tkape` contains information to collect the files with file mask `SAM.LOG*` from the `C:\Windows\System32\config` directory.

![File explorer showing 'RegistryHivesSystem.tkape' file, with details on SAM registry transaction files located at C:\Windows\System32\config.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_tkape.png)

KAPE also offers `Compound Targets`, which are essentially amalgamations of multiple targets. This feature accelerates the collection process by gathering multiple files defined across various targets in a single run. The `Compound` directory's `KapeTriage` file provides an overview of the contents of this compound target.

![Image showing KAPE Targets directory with 'Compound' sub-directory. Highlights 'KapeTriage.tkape' as a compound target file, detailing evidence collection paths for Antivirus, EventLogs, EvidenceOfExecution, and Amcache.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_compound.png)

Let's specify our source (in our scenario, it's `D:\`) and designate a location to store the harvested data. We can also determine an output folder to house the processed data from KAPE.

After configuring our options, let's hit the `Execute` button to initiate the data collection.

![gkape interface showing steps: 1. Specify source and destination, 2. Select target configurations, 3. Choose output type, 4. Execute KAPE.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_gui.png)

Upon execution, KAPE will commence the collection, storing the results in the predetermined destination.

The output directory of KAPE houses the fruits of the artifact collection and processing. The exact contents of this directory can differ based on the artifacts selected and the configurations set. In our demonstration, we opted for the `!SANS_Triage` collection target configuration. Let's navigate to KAPE's output directory to inspect the harvested data.

![File explorer showing KAPE's output with folders: Extend, ProgramData, Users, Windows, and files , LogFile, MFT, $Secure_SDS.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_output.png)

From the displayed results, it's evident that the `$MFT` file has been collected, along with the `Users` and `Windows` directories.

It's worth noting that KAPE has also harvested the `Windows event logs`, which are nestled within the Windows directory sub-folders.

![File explorer showing event logs in the System32 directory, including 'Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%40Operational.evtx' highlighted.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/win_dfir_kape_winevt.png)

What if we wanted to perform artifact collection remotely and en masse? This is where EDR solutions and [Velociraptor](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor) come into play.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms offer a significant advantage for incident response analysts. They enable remote acquisition and analysis of digital evidence. For instance, EDR platforms can display recently executed binaries or newly added files. Instead of sifting through individual systems, analysts can search for such indicators across the entire network. Another benefit is the capability to gather evidence, be it specific files or comprehensive forensic packages. This functionality expedites evidence collection and facilitates large-scale searching and collection.

[Velociraptor](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor) is a potent tool for gathering host-based information using Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) queries. Beyond this, Velociraptor can execute `Hunts` to amass various artifacts. A frequently utilized artifact is the `Windows.KapeFiles.Targets`. While KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) itself isn't open-source, its file collection logic, encoded in YAML, is accessible via the [KapeFiles project](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles). This approach is a staple in Rapid Triage.

To utilize Velociraptor for KapeFiles artifacts:

- Initiate a new Hunt.![Velociraptor interface showing a hunt with ID H.CJOH7UEPS5CUK, created and started on 2023-08-31, scheduled 102 times by admin.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/vel0.png)  
    ![Velociraptor interface for configuring a new hunt: Description 'Test hunt', expiry set to 8/14/2023, conditions set to 'Run everywhere', all orgs selected, and 'Start Hunt Immediately' checked.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/image33.png)
- Choose `Windows.KapeFiles.Targets` as the artifacts for collection.![Velociraptor interface for selecting artifacts to collect, highlighting 'Windows.KapeFiles.Targets' with a description of KAPE as a bulk collector tool for system triage.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/image64.png)
- Specify the collection to use.![Velociraptor interface for configuring artifact parameters, highlighting 'Configure Windows.KapeFiles.Targets' with a wrench icon.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/vel1.png)

![File explorer showing folders: ProgramData, Users, Windows.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/image37.png)

For remote memory dump collection using Velociraptor:

- Start a new Hunt, but this time, select the `Windows.Memory.Acquisition` artifact.![Velociraptor interface for selecting artifacts, highlighting 'Windows.Memory.Acquisition' with WinPmem64 tool for full memory image acquisition.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/image92.png)
- After the Hunt concludes, download the resulting archive. Within, you'll find a file named `PhysicalMemory.raw`, containing the memory dump.![Velociraptor interface showing hunts: 'memdump' and 'Test hunt', with details for 'memdump' including Hunt ID H.CJ8HV71H9V370, created by admin, running state, and download options.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/237/image45.png)

## Extracting Network Evidence

Throughout our exploration of the modules in the `SOC Analyst` path, we've delved extensively into the realm of network evidence, a fundamental aspect for any SOC analyst.

- First up, our `Intro to Network Traffic Analysis` and `Intermediate Network Traffic Analysis` modules covered `traffic capture analysis`. Think of traffic capture as a snapshot of all the digital conversations happening in our network. Tools like `Wireshark` or `tcpdump` allow us to capture and dissect these packets, giving us a granular view of data in transit.
- Then, our `Working with IDS/IPS` and `Detecting Windows Attacks with Splunk` modules covered the usage of IDS/IPS-derived data. `Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)` are our watchful sentinels, constantly monitoring network traffic for signs of malicious activity. When they spot something amiss, they alert us. On the other hand, `Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)` take it a step further. Not only do they detect, but they also take pre-defined actions to block or prevent those malicious activities.
- `Traffic flow` data, often sourced from tools like `NetFlow` or `sFlow`, provides us with a broader view of our network's behavior. While it might not give us the nitty-gritty details of each packet, it offers a high-level overview of traffic patterns.
- Lastly, our trusty `firewalls`. These are not just barriers that block or allow traffic based on predefined rules. Modern firewalls are intelligent beasts. They can identify applications, users, and even detect and block threats.
