So far, we have been able to make our code obfuscated and more difficult to read. However, the code still contains strings in cleartext, which may reveal its original functionality. In this section, we will try a couple of tools that should completely obfuscate the code and hide any remnants of its original functionality.
**Obfuscator**

Let's visit https://obfuscator.io. Before we click obfuscate, we will change String Array Encoding to Base64, as seen below:

```javascript
var _0x1ec6=['Bg9N','sfrciePHDMfty3jPChqGrgvVyMz1C2nHDgLVBIbnB2r1Bgu='];(function(_0x13249d,_0x1ec6e5){var _0x14f83b=function(_0x3f720f){while(--_0x3f720f){_0x13249d['push'](_0x13249d['shift']());}};_0x14f83b(++_0x1ec6e5);}(_0x1ec6,0xb4));var _0x14f8=function(_0x13249d,_0x1ec6e5){_0x13249d=_0x13249d-0x0;var _0x14f83b=_0x1ec6[_0x13249d];if(_0x14f8['eOTqeL']===undefined){var _0x3f720f=function(_0x32fbfd){var _0x523045='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789+/=',_0x4f8a49=String(_0x32fbfd)['replace'](/=+$/,'');var _0x1171d4='';for(var _0x44920a=0x0,_0x2a30c5,_0x443b2f,_0xcdf142=0x0;_0x443b2f=_0x4f8a49['charAt'](_0xcdf142++);~_0x443b2f&&(_0x2a30c5=_0x44920a%0x4?_0x2a30c5*0x40+_0x443b2f:_0x443b2f,_0x44920a++%0x4)?_0x1171d4+=String['fromCharCode'](0xff&_0x2a30c5>>(-0x2*_0x44920a&0x6)):0x0){_0x443b2f=_0x523045['indexOf'](_0x443b2f);}return _0x1171d4;};_0x14f8['oZlYBE']=function(_0x8f2071){var _0x49af5e=_0x3f720f(_0x8f2071);var _0x52e65f=[];for(var _0x1ed1cf=0x0,_0x79942e=_0x49af5e['length'];_0x1ed1cf<_0x79942e;_0x1ed1cf++){_0x52e65f+='%'+('00'+_0x49af5e['charCodeAt'](_0x1ed1cf)['toString'](0x10))['slice'](-0x2);}return decodeURIComponent(_0x52e65f);},_0x14f8['qHtbNC']={},_0x14f8['eOTqeL']=!![];}var _0x20247c=_0x14f8['qHtbNC'][_0x13249d];return _0x20247c===undefined?(_0x14f83b=_0x14f8['oZlYBE'](_0x14f83b),_0x14f8['qHtbNC'][_0x13249d]=_0x14f83b):_0x14f83b=_0x20247c,_0x14f83b;};console[_0x14f8('0x0')](_0x14f8('0x1'));
```

This code is obviously more obfuscated, and we can't see any remnants of our original code. We can now try running it in https://jsconsole.com to verify that it still performs its original function. Try playing with the obfuscation settings in https://obfuscator.io to generate even more obfuscated code, and then try rerunning it in https://jsconsole.com to verify it still performs its original function.
