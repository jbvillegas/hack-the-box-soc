# Credentials in Object Properties

---

## Description

Objects in Active Directory have a plethora of different properties; for example, a `user` object can contain properties that contain information such as:

- Is the account active
- When does the account expire
- When was the last password change
- What is the name of the account
- Office location for the employee and phone number

When administrators create accounts, they fill in those properties. A common practice in the past was to add the user's (or service account's) password in the `Description` or `Info` properties, thinking that administrative rights in AD are needed to view these properties. However, `every` domain user can read most properties of an object (including `Description` and `Info`).

---

## Attack

A simple PowerShell script can query the entire domain by looking for specific search terms or strings in the `Description` or `Info` fields:

```powershell
Function SearchUserClearTextInformation {
    Param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [Array] $Terms,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [String] $Domain
    )

    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($Domain)) {
        $dc = (Get-ADDomain).RIDMaster
    } else {
        $dc = (Get-ADDomain $Domain).RIDMaster
    }

    $list = @()
    foreach ($t in $Terms) {
        $list += "(`$_.Description -like '*$t*')"
        $list += "(`$_.Info -like '*$t*')"
    }

    Get-ADUser -Filter * -Server $dc -Properties Enabled,Description,Info,PasswordNeverExpires,PasswordLastSet |
        Where { Invoke-Expression ($list -join ' -OR ') } |
        Select SamAccountName,Enabled,Description,Info,PasswordNeverExpires,PasswordLastSet |
        fl
}
```

We will run the script to hunt for the string `pass` to find the password `Slavi123` in the `Description` property of the user `bonni`:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\bob\Downloads> SearchUserClearTextInformation -Terms "pass"
SamAccountName       : bonni
Enabled              : True
Description          : pass: Slavi123
Info                 :
PasswordNeverExpires : True
PasswordLastSet      : 05/12/2022 15.18.05
```

## Prevention

We have many options to prevent this attack or misconfiguration:

- `Perform` `continuous assessments` to detect the problem of storing credentials in properties of objects.
- `Educate` employees with high privileges to avoid storing credentials in properties of objects.
- `Automate` as much as possible of the user creation process to ensure administrators do not handle accounts manually, reducing the risk of introducing hardcoded credentials in user objects.

## Detection

Baselining users' behavior is the best technique for detecting abuse of exposed credentials in properties of objects. Although this can be tricky for regular user accounts, triggering an alert for administrators or service accounts whose behavior can be understood and baselined is easier. Automated tools that monitor user behavior have shown increased success in detecting abnormal logons. In the example above, assuming the provided credentials are up to date, we would expect events with event ID `4624`/`4625` (failed and successful logon) and `4768` (Kerberos TGT requested). Below is an example of event ID `4768`:

![Security event log 4768 showing a Kerberos ticket request by 'bonni' from IP ::ffff:172.16.18.25.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A6/Detect1.png)

Unfortunately, the event ID `4738` generated when a user object is modified does not show the specific property that was altered, nor does it provide the new values of properties. Therefore, we cannot use this event to detect if administrators add credentials to the properties of objects.

## Honeypot

Storing credentials in properties of objects is an excellent honeypot technique for not-very-mature environments. If we are struggling with basic cyber hygiene, then it is more likely expected to have such issues (storing credentials in properties of objects) in an AD environment. For setting up a honeypot user, we need to ensure the following:

- The password or credential is configured in the `Description` field, as it is the easiest to pick up by any adversary.
- The provided password is fake or incorrect.
- The account is enabled and has recent login attempts.
- While we can use a regular user or a service account, service accounts are more likely to have this exposed because administrators tend to create them manually. In contrast, automated HR systems often make employee accounts and the employees have likely changed the password already.
- The account has the last password configured 2+ years ago, which makes it more believable that the password will likely work.

Because the provided password is wrong, we would primarily expect failed logon attempts; three event IDs (`4625`, `4771`, and `4776`) can indicate this. Here is how they look in our playground environment if an attacker is attempting to authenticate with the account `svc-iis` and a wrong password:

- `4625`

![Security event log 4625 showing a failed logon attempt for 'svc-iis' from IP 172.16.18.20 due to a bad password.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A6/honeypot4dot3.png)

- `4771`

![Security event log 4771 showing failed Kerberos pre-authentication for 'svc-iis' from IP ::ffff:172.16.18.4, with failure code 0x18 indicating a wrong password.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A6/honeypot4.png)

- `4776`

![Security event log 4776 showing credential validation attempt for 'svc-iis' with error code 0xC000006A indicating a bad password.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A6/honeypot4dot2.png)

## Summary

This section explains how attackers can abuse credentials stored in Active Directory object properties. It focuses on the Description, Attack, Prevention, Detection, and Honeypot sections.

## What I Did

I reviewed the Hack The Box material, followed the examples, and reviewed the tools and steps shown in this section.

## What I Learned

I learned how easy it is for attackers to discover credentials hidden in user object properties when those values are readable to normal domain users, and how this can be mitigated through assessment, education, and automation.
