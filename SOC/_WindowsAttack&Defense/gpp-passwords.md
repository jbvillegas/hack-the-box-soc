# GPP Passwords

---

## Description

`SYSVOL` is a network share on all Domain Controllers, containing logon scripts, group policy data, and other required domain-wide data. AD stores all group policies in `\\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\`. When Microsoft released it with the Windows Server 2008, `Group Policy Preferences` (`GPP`) introduced the ability to store and use credentials in several scenarios, all of which AD stores in the policies directory in `SYSVOL`.

During engagements, we might encounter scheduled tasks and scripts executed under a particular user and contain the username and an encrypted version of the password in XML policy files. The encryption key that AD uses to encrypt the XML policy files (the `same` for all Active Directory environments) was released on Microsoft Docs, allowing anyone to decrypt credentials stored in the policy files. Anyone can decrypt the credentials because the `SYSVOL` folder is accessible to all 'Authenticated Users' in the domain, which includes users and computers. Microsoft published the [AES private key on MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN):

Also, as a reference, this is what an example XML file containing an encrypted password looks like (note that the property is called `cpassword`):

## Attack

To abuse `GPP Passwords`, we will use the [Get-GPPPassword](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1) function from `PowerSploit`, which automatically parses all XML files in the Policies folder in `SYSVOL`, picking up those with the `cpassword` property and decrypting them once detected:

        powershell
`PS C:\Users\bob\Downloads> Import-Module .\Get-GPPPassword.ps1 PS C:\Users\bob\Downloads> Get-GPPPassword  UserName  : svc-iis NewName   : [BLANK] Password  : abcd@123 Changed   : [BLANK] File      : \\EAGLE.LOCAL\SYSVOL\eagle.local\Policies\{73C66DBB-81DA-44D8-BDEF-20BA2C27056D}\             Machine\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml NodeName  : Groups Cpassword : qRI/NPQtItGsMjwMkhF7ZDvK6n9KlOhBZ/XShO2IZ80`

## Prevention

Once the encryption key was made public and started to become abused, Microsoft released a patch (`KB2962486)` in 2014 to prevent `caching credentials` in GPP. Therefore, GPP should no longer store passwords in new patched environments. However, unfortunately, there are a multitude of Active Directory environments built after 2015, which for some reason, do contain credentials in `SYSVOL`. It is therefore highly recommended to continuously assess and review the environment to ensure that no credentials are exposed here.

It is crucial to know that if an organization built its AD environment before 2014, it is likely that its credentials are still cached because the patch does not clear existing stored credentials (only prevents the caching of new ones).

## Detection

There are two detection techniques for this attack:

- Accessing the XML file containing the credentials should be a red flag if we are auditing file access; this is more realistic (due to volume otherwise) regarding detection if it is a dummy XML file, not associated with any GPO. In this case, there will be no reason for anyone to touch this file, and any attempt is likely suspicious. As demonstrated by `Get-GPPPasswords`, it parses all of the XML files in the Policies folder. For auditing, we can generate an event whenever a user reads the file:

![Advanced Security Settings for Groups.xml showing auditing enabled for 'Everyone' with read and execute access. Any access generates an event.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A3/audit1.png)

Once auditing is enabled, any access to the file will generate an Event with the ID `4663`:

![Security log Event 4663: User 'bob' accessing Groups.xml with GPP credentials.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A3/audit2.png)

- Logon attempts (failed or successful, depending on whether the password is up to date) of the user whose credentials are exposed is another way of detecting the abuse of this attack; this should generate one of the events `4624` (`successful logon`), `4625` (`failed logon`), or `4768` (`TGT requested`). A successful logon with the account from our attack scenario would generate the following event on the Domain Controller:

![Security log Event 4624: Successful logon for 'svc-iis' from IP 172.16.18.25. Note: IP correlation can determine if the event is legitimate or suspicious.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A3/audit3.png)

In the case of a service account, we may correlate logon attempts with the device from which the authentication attempt originates, as this should be easy to detect, assuming we know where certain accounts are used (primarily if the logon originated from a workstation, which is abnormal behavior for a service account).

## Honeypot

This attack provides an excellent opportunity for setting up a trap: we can use a semi-privileged user with a `wrong password`. Service accounts provide a more realistic opportunity because:

- The password is usually expected to be old, without recent or regular modifications.
- It is easy to ensure that the last password change is older than when the GPP XML file was last modified. If the user's password is changed after the file was modified, then no adversary will attempt to login with this account (the password is likely no longer valid).
- Schedule the user to perform any dummy task to ensure that there are recent logon attempts.

When we do the above, we can configure an alert that if any successful or failed logon attempts occur with this service account, it must be malicious (assuming that we whitelist the dummy task logon that simulates the logon activity in the alert).

Because the provided password is wrong, we would primarily expect failed logon attempts. Three event IDs (`4625`, `4771`, and `4776`) can indicate this; here is how they look for our playground environment if an attacker is attempting to authenticate with a wrong password:

- `4625`

![Security log Event 4625: Failed logon for 'svc-iis' due to bad password from IP 172.16.18.20, indicating a potential attacker or compromised device.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A3/honeypot4dot3.png)

- `4771`

![Security log Event 4771: Failed pre-authentication for 'svc-iis' from IP 172.16.18.4. Failure code 0x18 indicates a wrong password.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A3/honeypot4.png)

- `4776`

![Security log Event 4776: Failed credential validation for 'svc-iis' with error code 0xC000006A indicating a bad password.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A3/honeypot4dot2.png)
